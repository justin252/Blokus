  Game Rules:
  - Each player chooses a color and places that set of 21 pieces in front of 
  ``his/her side of the board.
  - The order of play is as follows: blue, yellow, red, green.
  - The first piece played by each player must cover a corner square.
  - Each new piece must touch at least one other piece of the same color, but 
    only at the corners.
  - Pieces of the same color cannot be in contact along an edge.
  - There are no restrictions on how many pieces of different colors may be in 
    contact with each other.
  - Once a piece has been placed on the board it cannot be moved during 
    subsequent turns.
  - The game ends when all players quit the game
  - Scores are tallied, and the player with the highest score is the winner.
  - Each player then counts the number of unit squares in his/her remaining 
    pieces (1 unit square = -1 point).

  During each player’s turn, they will be given a choice on whether they want to 
  continue the game if they think they have more movements left or whether they 
  want to quit the game. If they choose to quit the game, they won’t have their 
  turn. Else, they will be prompted to choose a piece, if it's an invalid piece 
  they have chosen a number for the piece that does not exist, the game will 
  have an error. They are then prompted to choose the orientation for the piece 
  that they have chosen. Again, if the orientation number for that piece does 
  not exist, the game will end with an error. Next, the player will be prompted 
  to place the piece on the board. If the placed piece position is valid, i.e it 
  touches the corner of one if the same colored pieces on the board but does not 
  touch any of the faces of same colored pieces and does not overlap on any of
  the existing pieces on the board, the piece will be placed. Then another 
  player will be prompted to do the same. If the placed piece position is 
  invalid, the player’s turn will be skipped.
